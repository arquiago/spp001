  <h2>About the Seminar</h2>
  <p>
    This term, the seminar will explore the multifaceted role of language (<em>logos</em>) in Platonic thought. We will investigate its connection to reality, its function in the dialectical process, and its power to shape the soul.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the inquiries in the <em>Cratylus</em> to the sophisticated philosophical methods of the later dialogues, we will trace the evolution of Plato's perspective on what it means to name, to define, and to know.
